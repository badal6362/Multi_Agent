This project is a Multi-Agent AI System built using Python (Flask) and React, designed to fulfill complex user goals by chaining multiple intelligent agents. Each agent performs a specific task (like fetching data from APIs) and passes enriched information to the next, forming an automated pipeline that works toward the final goal.
It simulates how real-world AI systems plan and collaborate to complete tasks. The system uses public APIs like SpaceX, OpenWeatherMap, and NewsAPI to perform tasks such as checking upcoming launches, retrieving weather conditions, and summarizing potential delays â€” all based on user input.
The backend handles the logic and agent orchestration, while the frontend provides a simple interface for users to input natural language goals and view structured results.
